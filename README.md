Bumblebee is an Excel interop for Dynamo. 

Features so far:

1. Awesome logo? (changed a little bit after consulting with the co-creator)
2. Read Excel (includes reading multiple sheets)
3. Write Excel (flat list, nested list (depth 2), nested list (depth 3). For nested lists of depth 3 the sheet name input has to be a list for excel to write data to multiple sheets)
4. Style Excel (border style, text style, fill style, new BB Classes instead of strings)
5. Conditional Formatting (Cell Value, Expression, 2/3 Color Scale as well as TopBottom Percentile are working)
6. Just finished doing the Primer for the basic functionality that already is in this repo. 
7. Custom nodes are ready to go. 

Working on:

1. Charts? 
2. Final implementation of COM object release functions and methods. Similar to one adopted in Conditional Formatting node.
