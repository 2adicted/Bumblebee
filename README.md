Bumblebee is an Excel interop for Dynamo. 

Features so far:

1. Awesome logo? (changed a little bit after consulting with the co-creator)
2. Read Excel. 
3. Write Excel.
4. Style Excel (border style, text style, fill style, new BB Classes instead of strings)
5. Conditional Formatting (Cell Value and Expression are working, next up is color scale + more testing)

Working on:

1. Writing multiple sheets? (David and Marcello both expressed interest in that)
2. Charts?
